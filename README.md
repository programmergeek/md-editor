# About the project

This projet came to be out of frustration with the contentful rich text editor
that provided no distinction between inline code and code blocks. This project is supposed to act
as a prototype for an add-on to replace the default rich text editor.

# Project Stack

- Typescript
- Next.js
- Material UI
- react-markdown
- react-syntax-highlighter

Looking back at this project using next.js may have been a bit over-kill. Using vanilla react would have
given me the same result.
